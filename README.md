# README

Rabbit Hole is an online platform for open discussions about any topic. The application will allow people to discuss ideas, trends, and current events.
Users can create new threads and start their own communities (called burrows) or join an existing one. These Burrows serve as a central hub for all discussions about that topic.
Users can create new burrows, which is an opportunity to create a conversation on interesting subjects. This platform also allows users to have creative dialogue with our post and update features.
